Create Spring MVC using java Configuration
	WebAppInitializer  extends AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer
	RootConfig
	WebConfig
	
	HomeController
	
Add Spring security and related Configuration
	SecurityWebApplicationInitializer  extends AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer
	SpringSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
	
	
	Uses form based authentication
	Login Form is generated by Spring Security
	
	
	TODO part
	1. Securely transfer user Credentials from client to server on login submit and use HTTPS
	2. Store user password in DB in non reversible encrypted format  and use Bcrypt like encrypted password validator to validate password
	3. User Details service actually using Database to store and retrieve database. Or use DaoAuthenticationProvider OR JdbcDaoImpl.
	4. User can have roles i.e. GrantedAuthorities. Initialize UserDetail with Granted Authorities.
	5. Define a Custom ServletFilter and register it before, in between or after Spring security filter chain.
